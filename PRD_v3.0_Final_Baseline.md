* **Version:** 3.0
* **Date:** July 18, 2025
* **Status:** Strategic Realignment - Final Baseline
* **Previous Version:** 2.6

## Version 3.0 Changes Summary

This version addresses critical specification gaps identified during a comprehensive application audit. The export functionality has been redesigned to provide a consistent, predictable user experience across all modules, aligning the application's behavior with its core philosophy as a "thinking tool."

* **Added Section 1.7:** Codified the new "Unified Export Strategy."
* **Updated Section 1.6:** Added explicit export functionality details to all module specifications.
* **Updated Section 5:** Added the "Unified Export Strategy" to the Key Decisions Log.
* **Overhauled Section 3:** Redefined the active roadmap to prioritize the implementation of the new export features.

## Section 1: Project Blueprint (The "What")

### 1.1. Core Philosophy & Vision

The Objective Builder is a "thinking tool" designed to solve communication and alignment gaps within teams. Its philosophy is built on the **HSE (Headlights, Steering Wheel, Engine)** management framework:

* **H - Headlights (Strategy):** Used when the team's destination is unclear (`Brainstorm`, `Choose` modules).
* **S - Steering Wheel (Tactical Planning):** Used when the goal is clear, but the plan is not (`Objectives` module).
* **E - Engine (Execution):** Represents the team's day-to-day work, which this tool is designed to enhance.

### 1.2. Foundational Analogies

* **The "Line of Scrimmage":** Views progress as a constant struggle against restraining forces.
* **The "Fish in a Red Ocean":** Highlights the high-stakes nature of strategic decision-making.
* **"The Huddle vs. Run the Play":** Differentiates the reflective planning phase from the high-pressure execution phase.

### 1.3. User Experience (UX) Flow

The application is a client-side tool that guides users through a structured thinking process.

1.  **Homepage (`index.html`):** The user is presented with two primary paths: Direction (for strategy) or Alignment (for tactical planning).
2.  **Module Wizards:** The user is guided through a series of multi-step wizards for each module (`Brainstorm` -> `Choose` -> `Objectives`).
3.  **Module Export:** At the completion of each module, users can export their work in multiple formats.
4.  **Global Task List:** At any point, the user can access `TaskListPage.html` to manage tasks derived from their planning and perform unified project exports.
5.  **Final Output:** Users can copy results as formatted Markdown or download them as a JSON file.

### 1.4. Non-Goals

To maintain focus, the following features are explicitly out of scope for the current development phase:
* Real-time Collaboration
* Team & Resource Management
* Full Project Management Suite

### 1.5. Target User Personas

* **"Manager Mike":** Needs to align his team on a new project. Values structure and clear outcomes.
* **"Founder Freya":** Needs to make a critical strategic decision. Values clarity and de-risking choices.

### 1.6. Module Specifications

#### A. Brainstorm Module (5 Steps)

* **Purpose:** Focuses on divergent thinking and idea generation.
* **Export Functionality:** The final page (`brainstorm_step5.html`) includes "Copy as Markdown" and "Download JSON" buttons.
* **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### B. Choose Module (5 Steps)

* **Purpose:** Focuses on convergent thinking and decision-making.
* **Export Functionality:** Includes "Copy as Markdown" and "Download JSON" buttons.
* **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### C. Objectives Module (7 Steps)

* **Purpose:** Focuses on tactical planning and resource allocation.
* **Export Functionality:** The final page (`objectives_step7.html`) includes "Copy as Markdown" and "Download JSON" buttons.
* **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### D. Task List Page

* **Purpose:** A central hub for managing tasks and project data.
* **Export Functionality:** Comprehensive suite including "Copy as Markdown," "Copy as CSV," and a "Download Full Project (JSON)" option.
* **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced)

### 1.7. Unified Export Strategy

1.  **Module Self-Sufficiency:** Every module (Brainstorm, Choose, Objectives) must have its own dedicated export function on its final page.
2.  **Format Consistency:** All module exports must offer "Copy as Markdown" and "Download JSON" at a minimum.
3.  **Comprehensive Project Export:** The Task List Page will offer a "Download Full Project" option, bundling data from all completed modules into a single JSON file.
4.  **Defined Data Flow:** The Objectives module will automatically generate tasks in the Task List. The Brainstorm and Choose modules will provide an option to create tasks.

## Section 2: Technical Architecture & Implementation

### 2.1. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Data Storage:** Browser `localStorage` for session persistence.
* **Development Server:** Python's built-in `http.server` or Flask's development server.

### 2.2. Export Data Formats & Technical Specifications

#### 2.2.1. JSON Export Format

* **Module-Specific (e.g., `brainstorm-results-YYYY-MM-DD.json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "exportType": "brainstorm",
      "exportDate": "2025-07-18T21:44:17.000Z",
      "data": {
        "step1": "User response...",
        "step2": "User response...",
        "step3": "User response...",
        "step4": "User response...",
        "step5": "User response..."
      }
    }
    ```
* **Unified Project Export (`project_arrowhead_export.json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "exportType": "unified_project",
      "exportDate": "2025-07-18T21:44:17.000Z",
      "brainstorm": { "...": "..." },
      "choose": { "...": "..." },
      "objectives": { "...": "..." },
      "taskList": [

## Section 4: Team & Operational Model

This project is developed via the Phoenix Protocol, a collaborative workflow between the Project Lead and the AI Software Architect. For detailed roles, responsibilities, the cyclical refresh process, and development protocols, please refer to the Operational Manual & Decision Log (OMDL).

---

## Section 5: Key Decisions Log

### Decision: Adopted the "Unified Export Strategy"

**Date:** July 18, 2025

**Rationale:** An application audit revealed inconsistent and missing export features, creating a broken user journey. This strategy creates a consistent, logical user experience and provides a clear blueprint for development.

### Decision: Pivot to "Thinking Tool" MVP

**Rationale:** The project's unique value is the guided thinking process, not competing with established project management tools.

### Decision: Client-Side Architecture with No Backend

**Rationale:** Drastically reduces complexity and development time, allowing for rapid iteration on the core user experience.
