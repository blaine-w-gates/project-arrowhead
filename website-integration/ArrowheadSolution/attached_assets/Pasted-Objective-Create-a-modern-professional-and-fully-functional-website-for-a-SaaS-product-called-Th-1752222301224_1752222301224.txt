Objective: Create a modern, professional, and fully functional website for a SaaS product called "The Objective Builder." The site's primary goals are to educate visitors on a unique strategic framework, generate leads through a free tool and content, and convert users to paid "Pro" and "Team" tiers.

Persona: You are an expert web designer and developer specializing in creating high-converting websites for SaaS companies. Your design should be clean, strategic, and trustworthy, avoiding playful or overly corporate aesthetics.

3. Authentication & Sign-Up Flow
IMPORTANT: The sign-up process is tiered and must be handled as follows:

Free Tier: There is NO profile creation or sign-up. The "Use Free Tool" buttons on the Homepage and Pricing page should link directly to the web application itself, which operates using localStorage.

Pro & Team Tiers: Clicking the "Start Pro Trial" or "Start Team Trial" buttons on the Pricing page must lead to a separate, dedicated sign-up/login page. This page is where a user will create their profile (email/password) to access the paid features. This page will need fields for "Email," "Password," and a "Create Account" button.
