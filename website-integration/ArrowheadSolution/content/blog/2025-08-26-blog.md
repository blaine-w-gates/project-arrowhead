## Model switching strategy:

**Use GPT-5 (me) for**:

* Complex backend architecture decisions
* Database schema design and security implementation
* Integration troubleshooting with multiple systems
* Performance optimization

**Switch to Claude 4 for**:

* Rapid iteration on frontend components
* Content management and blog article processing
* UI/UX refinements and user testing
* Quick debugging of specific issues

**Ready to begin Phase 1 immediately.**Â I need the Supabase project URL and anon key to provide to Architect, then I'll build the secure Cloudflare function endpoint.
