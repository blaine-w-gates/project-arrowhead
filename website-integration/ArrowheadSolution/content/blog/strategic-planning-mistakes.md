Strategic planning is crucial for business success, but many organizations fall into common traps that can derail their efforts.

## The Big Five

1. Setting vague objectives with no measurable outcomes.
2. Planning without stakeholder alignment.
3. Ignoring resource constraints and tradeoffs.
4. Treating strategy as a one-time event instead of a process.
5. Failing to close the loop with review and iteration.

## How to Avoid Them

- Establish clear, measurable outcomes upfront.
- Align leadership early and revisit alignment at each milestone.
- Explicitly prioritize and sequence initiatives.
- Create a cadence for review and adjust based on new information.

> A well-run planning process creates clarity, momentum, and accountability.
