# Project Arrowhead Documentation Index

This index clarifies which documents are active, baseline, or archived to avoid confusion and ensure everyone reads the correct sources.

## Active Documents (current focus)
- Sprint Plan v8.0: `Sprint_Plan_v8.0.md`
- Auth Strategy vNext: `docs/Auth_Strategy_vNext.md`

## Living Baselines (single source of truth)
- SLAD v5.2 Final (as-built architecture): `SLAD_v5.2_Final.md`
- PRD v4.2 Draft (Paid MVP additions): `PRD_v4.2_Draft.md`
- OMDL v11.2 Draft (protocols and operations): `OMDL_v11.2_Draft.md`

These must be kept up to date as the system evolves.

## Historical Archives (frozen)
- Sprint Plan v7.0: `Sprint_Plan_v7.0.md` (Superseded by v8.0)
- System Logic Architecture v3.0: `System_Logic_Architecture_v3.0.md`
- Older sprint plans and docs located at repository root.

## Documentation cadence
- At sprint start: run a Documentation Sync (read active + baselines).
- During sprint: PRs include doc updates (ADRs and baselines as needed).
- End of sprint: quick doc review to ensure baselines match the as-built system.
