# Documentation Update Status Report

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Report Type:** Gap Analysis Execution Status  
**Related:** Architect 11 Gap Analysis, PRD v5.0, Sprint Plan v9.0

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **Architect 11's gap analysis is EXCELLENT and has been partially executed.**

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ **3 immediate actions COMPLETED** (OMDL update, env setup, archives)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **2 major actions BLOCKED** (awaiting PM answers to PRD v5.0 Q1-Q5)
- üìã **Clear path forward** once Q1-Q5 are answered

---

## What Architect 11 Analyzed

Architect 11 reviewed all 6 existing baseline documents and identified the gap between:
- **Current State:** Individual-User Paid Model (SLAD v5.2, PRD v4.2, Sprint v8.0)
- **Target State:** Team-Based MVP (PRD v5.0, Sprint v9.0)

### Key Finding

**The pivot from Individual-User to Team-Based MVP renders most existing architecture/product docs obsolete.**

The data model, business logic, and technical architecture are fundamentally different:
- **Old:** Single-user, simple schema, localStorage optional
- **New:** Multi-tenant, complex permissions, real-time collaboration, RLS

---

## Actions Completed (Immediate)

### ‚úÖ Action 1: Archive Obsolete Docs

**Status:** ALREADY DONE (commit `704cc44`)

| Document | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| PRD v4.2 | `docs/archive/prd/` | ‚úÖ Archived with SUPERSEDED banner |
| Sprint v8.0 | `docs/archive/sprint-plans/` | ‚úÖ Archived with SUPERSEDED banner |

**Result:** Clean separation between obsolete (Individual-User) and current (Team MVP) specs.

---

### ‚úÖ Action 2: Update OMDL v11.2 ‚Üí v11.3

**Status:** COMPLETED (commit `f482a3f`)

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Removed Section 7.0 (Implementation Canon) - obsolete
- ‚úÖ Added pointer to SLAD v6.0 (pending) for current architecture
- ‚úÖ Noted key changes: multi-tenant, RLS, real-time, permissions
- ‚úÖ Updated version to v11.3
- ‚úÖ Updated docs/README.md references

**File:** `docs/OMDL_v11.3_Draft.md`

**Why:** Section 7.0 claimed "in-memory storage" which is dangerously obsolete. Removed to prevent confusion.

---

### ‚úÖ Action 3: Create PRODUCTION_ENV_SETUP v2.0

**Status:** COMPLETED (commit `f482a3f`)

**New Document:** `docs/PRODUCTION_ENV_SETUP_v2.0_Draft.md`

**Contents:**
- **Removed Obsolete Vars:**
  - `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, etc.
  - `STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` (single-tier)

- **Added New Vars:**
  - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_SMALL_TEAM` ($29/month, 1-10 members)
  - `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_LARGE_TEAM` ($99/month, 11-50 members)
  - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (team invitations)
  - `JWT_SECRET`, `WEBSOCKET_SECRET` (auth & real-time)

- **Includes:**
  - Complete setup checklist
  - Security best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Migration instructions from v1.0

**Estimated Work:** Medium (Architect said), but now DONE.

**Why:** Team MVP requires entirely different infrastructure (Supabase, tiered billing, email).

---

## Actions Blocked (Awaiting PM)

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Action 4: Create SLAD v6.0 (BLOCKED)

**Owner:** Architect 11 will draft

**Why Blocked:** Requires PRD v5.0 to be FINAL (Q1-Q5 answered)

**What It Will Include:**
- New multi-tenant data model (10+ new tables)
- Real-time architecture (WebSocket, lock-based editing)
- RLS security policies (comprehensive section)
- Team-based API endpoints (all new)
- Removal of obsolete single-user endpoints

**Estimated Work:** LARGE

**Timeline:** Architect 11 will draft immediately after PM answers Q1-Q5

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Action 5: Update TESTING_STRATEGY v1.1 (BLOCKED)

**Owner:** Architect 11 will provide bullet points ‚Üí Cascade will insert

**Why Blocked:** Contingent on SLAD v6.0 and PRD v5.0 finalization

**What Will Be Added:**
- Section: "Team MVP Testing Strategy (v9.0 Scope)"
- RLS policy tests
- Permission function unit tests (`has_permission()`)
- WebSocket/real-time E2E tests (concurrent editing, lock timeouts)
- Team invitation E2E tests

**Estimated Work:** SMALL (addendum only)

**Timeline:** After Q1-Q5 answered and SLAD v6.0 drafted

---

## The 5 Critical Questions (BLOCKER)

**Location:** PRD v5.0 Section 10

All documentation finalization is BLOCKED until PM answers these:

### Q1: Virtual Persona Task Workflow
**Question:** How does Manager manage tasks assigned to Virtual Personas (who have no login)?

**Options:**
- A: Tasks appear in Manager's God-view RRGT when filtering by persona ‚úÖ **(Recommended)**
- B: Tasks show in special "Unassigned/Virtual Persona" section in Scoreboard
- C: Virtual Personas cannot be assigned tasks

---

### Q2: Incognito Task in Dial
**Question:** What should Manager see if prioritized Item is from Incognito task?

**Options:**
- A: Show "[Private Task]" placeholder ‚úÖ **(Recommended)**
- B: Show full Item name (breaks privacy)
- C: Don't allow Incognito task Items in Dial

---

### Q3: Team Merge Strategy
**Question:** How should Project ownership transfer work when merging teams?

**Options:**
- A: Transfer ownership (move projects, delete old team) ‚úÖ **(Recommended, but can defer)**
- B: Copy data (duplicate projects into new team)
- C: Defer decision (not needed for MVP)

---

### Q4: Permission Grid UI Complexity
**Question:** Is simplified Permission Grid acceptable for MVP?

**Simplified (Recommended):**
- Row per team member
- Role dropdown
- "Edit Perms" button ‚Üí modal with project checkboxes
- **Timeline:** Part of Sprint v9.0 Phase 2

**Full Version:**
- Collapsible column groups
- Sub-columns for Add/View/Edit
- Search bar, archive toggle
- **Timeline:** +2-3 weeks additional work

---

### Q5: Real-Time Editing Technology
**Question:** Confirm lock-based editing is acceptable (vs simultaneous CRDT)?

**Lock-Based (Recommended):**
- ‚úÖ 1-2 weeks implementation
- ‚úÖ One editor at a time
- ‚úÖ Others see "User X editing..." banner
- **Timeline:** Part of Sprint v9.0 Phase 3

**CRDT/OT (Future):**
- ‚ùå 6-8 weeks implementation
- ‚úÖ True Google Docs style simultaneous editing
- **Timeline:** Would delay MVP significantly

---

## Recommended PM Actions (In Order)

### **Step 1: Answer Q1-Q5** ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT - BLOCKS EVERYTHING**

**How:** Review PRD v5.0 Section 10, choose one option per question.

**Format:** Simply reply with:
```
Q1: Option A
Q2: Option A  
Q3: Option C (defer to post-MVP)
Q4: Simplified version
Q5: Lock-based
```

---

## Timeline Estimate (After Q1-Q5)

**Assuming Q1-Q5 answered today:**

| Task | Duration | Owner | Start |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Cascade: Finalize PRD v5.0 | 15 min | Cascade | Immediate |
| Architect: Draft SLAD v6.0 | 2-4 hours | Architect 11 | After PRD final |
| Architect: Testing addendum | 30 min | Architect 11 | Concurrent |
| Cascade: Insert testing addendum | 10 min | Cascade | After Architect provides |
| **TOTAL DOCUMENTATION** | **~4 hours** | **Team** | **Same day** |
| Sprint v9.0 Phase 1 begins | 1.5 weeks | Cascade | After docs final |

**Result:** Team MVP implementation can begin **same day** as Q1-Q5 answers.

## What Architect 11 Should Do Next

### **Immediate (While Waiting for Q1-Q5):**

Nothing. Architect 11's gap analysis is complete and excellent. All immediate actions have been executed by Cascade.

### **After PM Answers Q1-Q5:**

1. **Read finalized PRD v5.0** (with Q1-Q5 answers incorporated)
2. **Draft SLAD v6.0** based on finalized requirements
3. **Provide testing addendum** bullet points for TESTING_STRATEGY
4. **Review Sprint Plan v9.0** and confirm Phase 1 database schema matches SLAD v6.0
5. **Approve documentation baseline** as ready for implementation
6. **Direct Cascade:** "Begin Sprint v9.0 Phase 1: Database Foundation"

**Everything else is automated:**
- ‚úÖ Archives complete
- ‚úÖ OMDL updated
- ‚úÖ Env setup created
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting on you for Q1-Q5
- ü§ñ Architect + Cascade will execute rest automatically

**Recommended:**
