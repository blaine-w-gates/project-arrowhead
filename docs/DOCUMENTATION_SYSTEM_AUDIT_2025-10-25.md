## Documentation System Architecture

### Golden Rule (Established October 25, 2025)

**"All STRATEGIC documentation lives in `/docs/`. Component-specific docs live WITH the component."**

This creates two distinct documentation tiers:

1. **Strategic Tier (`/docs/`):** Architecture, requirements, operations, decisions
2. **Component Tier (subdirectories):** Component-specific guides, READMEs, runbooks

---

## Tier 1: Strategic Documentation (`/docs/`)

### Current Living Baselines (11 files)

| File | Type | Status | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| `README.md` | Index | ✅ Current | Documentation navigation |
| `SLAD_v5.2_Final.md` | Architecture | ✅ Current | System architecture baseline |
| `PRD_v5.0_Draft.md` | Requirements | ✅ Current | Product requirements (Team MVP) |
| `Sprint_Plan_v9.0.md` | Planning | ✅ Current | Current sprint plan |
| `OMDL_v11.2_Draft.md` | Operations | ✅ Current | Operational manual |
| `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` | Operations | ✅ Current | Test strategy |
| `PRODUCTION_ENV_SETUP.md` | Operations | ✅ Current | Environment setup |
| `ARCHITECT_ONBOARDING_v1.0.md` | Process | ✅ Current | AI architect training |
| `Auth_Strategy_vNext.md` | Sprint Doc | ⚠️ Historical | Sprint 8 auth plan (completed) |
| `data-health-runbook.md` | Runbook | ✅ Current | DB health procedures |
| `DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM_RULES.md` | Process | ✅ Current | **THIS DOCUMENT's companion** |

**Note:** `Auth_Strategy_vNext.md` should be archived after Team MVP begins (was Sprint 8 doc).

### Architecture Decision Records (6 files)

Located in `/docs/adr/`:

| File | Status | Superseded? |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `ADR-001-billing-provider-stripe-checkout-portal.md` | ✅ Active | No |
| `ADR-002-tenant-model-individual-only-mvp.md` | ⚠️ Superseded | Yes (by Team MVP pivot) |
| `ADR-003-subscriptions-data-model-and-entitlements.md` | ✅ Active | No |
| `ADR-004-auth-endpoint-naming-and-cookie-contract.md` | ✅ Active | No |
| `ADR-005-stripe-webhook-security-idempotency.md` | ✅ Active | No |
| `ADR-006-environments-and-secrets-management.md` | ✅ Active | No |

**Action Item:** ADR-002 needs "Superseded by ADR-00X (Team MVP)" note when Team MVP ADR is created.

| `DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM_AUDIT_2025-10-25.md` | **THIS FILE** - Complete system audit |

---

## Tier 2: Component Documentation

### Website Integration (`/website-integration/`)

#### Root Level (1 file)

| File | Status | Correct Location? |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Integration practices for website components |

**Rationale:** This is specifically about integrating website components, not strategic architecture. Belongs with website code.

#### ArrowheadSolution Component (`/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/`)

##### Component Root (2 files)

| File | Status | Correct Location? |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `README.md` | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Component overview/setup |
| `CONTENT_MANAGEMENT.md` | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Component-specific workflow (blog management) |

**Rationale:** Both are specific to ArrowheadSolution component, not strategic docs.

##### Component Docs Subdirectory (`/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/docs/`)

| File | Type | Status | Correct Location? |
|------|------|--------|-------------------|
| `architecture-diagram.md` | Technical | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Component architecture |
| `cloudflare-access-runbook.md` | Runbook | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Component-specific operations |
| `lead-magnet-api.md` | API Doc | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Component API spec |
| `logging-migration-guide.md` | Migration | ✅ Correct | **YES** - Component-specific migration |

**Rationale:** These are operational docs specific to ArrowheadSolution deployment/operations, not strategic baseline docs.

**Note:** `/docs/README.md` references these correctly as "Component-Specific Docs" in Section 11.

##### Admin Component (`/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/server/admin/`)

| File | Status | Correct Location? |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `README.md` | ✅ Correct | **YES** - AdminJS setup guide |

**Rationale:** Component-specific setup documentation.

##### Blog Content (`/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/content/blog/`)

**7 markdown files** - All blog posts, correct location.

##### CI Docs (`/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/.ci/`)

**3 markdown files** - CI/CD documentation, correct location (with CI config).

## Why This Two-Tier System Works

### Strategic Tier (`/docs/`) - "What and Why"

**Purpose:** Long-term architectural truth, product decisions, operations baseline

**Audience:**
- AI Architects (strategic decisions)
- AI Developers (implementation context)
- Project Manager (product direction)
- Future team members (understanding system)

**Characteristics:**
- Versioned (e.g., v5.2)
- Archived when superseded
- Referenced across entire project
- High-level, cross-cutting concerns

**Examples:**
- ✅ SLAD (describes entire system architecture)
- ✅ PRD (defines product requirements)
- ✅ ADRs (record major decisions)
- ✅ TESTING_STRATEGY (applies to all testing)

### Component Tier (subdirectories) - "How"

**Purpose:** Implementation details, deployment procedures, component-specific workflows

**Audience:**
- Developers working on that component
- Operations team deploying that component
- Content managers using that workflow

**Characteristics:**
- Not versioned (updated in place)
- Lives WITH the code it documents
- Specific to one component/workflow
- Implementation details, not strategy

**Examples:**
- ✅ ArrowheadSolution/README.md (setup instructions)
- ✅ ArrowheadSolution/CONTENT_MANAGEMENT.md (blog workflow)
- ✅ ArrowheadSolution/docs/lead-magnet-api.md (API implementation)
- ✅ server/admin/README.md (AdminJS setup)

## Search Protocol for AI Systems

### Step 1: Determine Document Type

**Is it strategic or component-specific?**

| If document is about... | Look in... |
|------------------------|------------|
| System architecture | `/docs/SLAD_*.md` |
| Product requirements | `/docs/PRD_*.md` |
| Current sprint plan | `/docs/Sprint_Plan_*.md` |
| Operational baseline | `/docs/OMDL_*.md`, `/docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` |
| Past decisions | `/docs/adr/` |
| Historical versions | `/docs/archive/{type}/` |
| Component setup | `{component}/README.md` |
| Component operations | `{component}/docs/` |
| Blog post content | `/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/content/blog/` |

### Step 2: Use Documentation Index

**Always start here:** `/docs/README.md`

This index lists:
- All current living baselines
- All ADRs
- Archive structure
- Links to component docs

### Step 3: Follow Naming Conventions

**Living Baselines:**
- Format: `{TYPE}_v{X}.{Y}_{STATUS}.md`
- Examples: `SLAD_v5.2_Final.md`, `PRD_v5.0_Draft.md`
- Location: `/docs/` (root level)

**ADRs:**
- Format: `ADR-{NNN}-{kebab-case-title}.md`
- Examples: `ADR-001-billing-provider-stripe-checkout-portal.md`
- Location: `/docs/adr/`

**Archives:**
- Location: `/docs/archive/{type}/`
- Types: `prd`, `slad`, `sprint-plans`, `omdl`, `process-docs`, `operations`

**Component Docs:**
- Component README: `{component}/README.md`
- Runbooks/Guides: `{component}/docs/{name}.md`

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why isn't `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` in `/docs/`?

**A:** It's specific to website integration workflows, not strategic architecture. It belongs with the website code it documents.

### Q: Why does ArrowheadSolution have its own `docs/` subdirectory?

**A:** It's a large component with operational runbooks (Cloudflare Access, lead magnet API, logging migration). These are component-specific operations, not strategic baseline docs.

### Q: Should `Auth_Strategy_vNext.md` be archived?

**A:** Yes, after Team MVP work begins. It was Sprint 8's implementation plan (passwordless auth). Should be moved to `/docs/archive/operations/` with a note that it was completed.

### Q: How do I know if a new doc goes in `/docs/` vs component directory?

**A:** Ask: "Is this strategic (affects entire system, long-term baseline) or tactical (specific to one component, implementation detail)?"

- Strategic → `/docs/`
- Tactical → Component directory

### Q: Can component docs reference strategic docs?

**A:** Yes! Example: ArrowheadSolution/README.md can say "See `/docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for testing approach."

### Q: Can strategic docs reference component docs?

**A:** Yes, sparingly. `/docs/README.md` has a "Component-Specific Docs" section that lists them.

## Maintenance Cadence

### After Every Sprint

1. **Archive completed Sprint Plan:**
   - Move `/docs/Sprint_Plan_v{N}.md` → `/docs/archive/sprint-plans/`
   - Add SUPERSEDED banner
   - Create new Sprint Plan

2. **Update Living Baselines:**
   - If architecture changed significantly: Create SLAD v{X+1}
   - If requirements changed: Create PRD v{X+1}
   - If operations changed: Create OMDL v{X+1}

3. **Update Documentation Index:**
   - Update `/docs/README.md` with new versions
   - Update archive structure section

### After Major Decisions

1. **Create ADR:**
   - Format: `ADR-{next-number}-{title}.md`
   - Location: `/docs/adr/`
   - Update `/docs/README.md` ADR list

### When Adding New Components

1. **Component README:**
   - Create `{component}/README.md`
   - Document setup, usage, architecture

2. **Component Runbooks (if needed):**
   - Create `{component}/docs/{runbook}.md`
   - Reference from `/docs/README.md` "Component-Specific Docs" section

## System Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**The documentation system is now properly organized and fully audited.**

**What Changed (October 25, 2025):**
1. Moved all strategic docs from root → `/docs/`
2. Archived PRD v4.2 and Sprint Plan v8.0 (superseded)
3. Added SUPERSEDED banners to archived docs
4. Created DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM_RULES.md
5. Updated `/docs/README.md` with corrected paths
6. Verified component docs are correctly located
7. Created this comprehensive audit

**Next Actions:**
- None required - system is complete
- Follow maintenance cadence going forward
- Archive `Auth_Strategy_vNext.md` when Team MVP begins

---

## Conclusion

**For AI Systems:** The documentation is now 100% searchable and predictable. Always start with `/docs/README.md`, then follow the two-tier system.

**For Humans:** Strategic docs in `/docs/`, component docs with components. Simple and maintainable.

**For Future:** This audit serves as the baseline. Any deviation from this structure should be intentional and documented.
