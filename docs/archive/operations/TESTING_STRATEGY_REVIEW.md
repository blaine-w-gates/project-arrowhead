# Testing Strategy Review - Team Discussion Guide
**Project Arrowhead - Sprint 2 Planning**

## Purpose

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing strategy for team review and approval before Sprint 2 implementation begins.

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Limited test coverage (24 E2E tests, 1 unit test)  
**Target State:** Comprehensive multi-layer testing (60% unit, 30% integration, 10% E2E)  
**Timeline:** 3-phase implementation across Sprints 2-4  
**Estimated Effort:** 20-28 hours for Sprint 2

---

## Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Testing Philosophy Approval

**Proposed Approach: Testing Pyramid**

```
        ╱──────╲
       ╱  E2E   ╲     10% - Critical user journeys
      ╱──────────╲
     ╱Integration ╲   30% - API, services, database  
    ╱──────────────╲
   ╱  Unit Tests    ╲  60% - Business logic, utilities
  ╱────────────────╲
```

**Question for Team:**
- ✅ Approve this distribution?
- ✅ Any concerns about coverage targets?
- ✅ Budget approved for tooling/infrastructure?

### 2. Tool Selection

**Recommended Stack:**

| Layer | Tool | Why | Cost |
|-------|------|-----|------|
| Unit | Vitest | Fast, ESM support, already installed | Free |
| Integration | Supertest | Industry standard for API testing | Free |
| E2E | Playwright | Already in use, multi-browser | Free |
| Component | Testing Library | React best practice | Free |
| Coverage | Vitest v8 | Built-in, accurate | Free |

**Question for Team:**
- ✅ Approve these tools?
- ✅ Any preference changes?
- ✅ Training needs identified?

### 3. Coverage Targets

**Proposed Thresholds:**

```typescript
{
  lines: 80,      // 80% line coverage
  functions: 80,  // 80% function coverage
  branches: 75,   // 75% branch coverage
  statements: 80  // 80% statement coverage
}
```

**Question for Team:**
- ✅ Are these targets realistic?
- ✅ Should we start lower and ramp up?
- ✅ Any code exemptions needed?

---

## Sprint 2 Implementation Plan

### Priority 1: Admin Panel Testing (MUST HAVE)

**Estimated: 12-16 hours**

#### A. E2E Authentication Tests
```typescript
tests/e2e/admin/
├── admin-auth.spec.ts          // Login, logout, session
├── admin-rbac.spec.ts          // Role permissions  
└── admin-security.spec.ts      // Rate limiting, CSRF
```

**Scenarios:**
- ✅ Valid/invalid login
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 attempts)
- ✅ Role-based access (4 roles)

#### B. API Integration Tests
```typescript
tests/integration/api/
├── admin-auth.test.ts          // Auth endpoints
├── admin-users.test.ts         // User CRUD
└── admin-audit.test.ts         // Audit logging
```

**Scenarios:**
- ✅ POST /api/admin/login
- ✅ POST /api/admin/logout
- ✅ GET /api/admin/users
- ✅ Audit log verification

#### C. Unit Tests
```typescript
tests/unit/server/admin/
├── auth.test.ts                // Password utilities
├── middleware.test.ts          // Rate limiting
└── validation.test.ts          // Input validation
```

**Scenarios:**
- ✅ Password hashing/verification
- ✅ Rate limit logic
- ✅ Audit log creation

### Priority 2: Infrastructure (SHOULD HAVE)

**Estimated: 4-6 hours**

```bash
# Dependencies
npm install -D supertest @types/supertest
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event

# Configuration
- vitest.config.ts (create/update)
- tests/setup.ts (global setup)
- tests/fixtures/* (test data)
```

### Priority 3: Legacy Test Updates (NICE TO HAVE)

**Estimated: 4-6 hours**

Files to review/update:
- `tests/e2e/admin-access.spec.ts` ← Update for AdminJS
- `tests/e2e/admin-redirect.spec.ts` ← Verify new flow
- `tests/e2e/admin-noindex.spec.ts` ← SEO check

## Questions for Discussion

### 1. Sprint 2 Scope

**Option A: Full Implementation (20-28 hours)**
- ✅ All admin tests
- ✅ Full infrastructure
- ✅ Legacy updates
- ⏱️ 5 days (1 sprint)

**Option B: Phased Approach (12-16 hours)**
- ✅ Admin E2E only
- ✅ Basic infrastructure
- ⏱️ 3 days
- 📋 API tests in Sprint 3

**Team Decision:** _______________

### 2. Test Execution Strategy

**When to run tests?**

```yaml
# Proposed CI/CD flow
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  unit-tests:           # Every push (fast)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
  integration-tests:    # Every PR (medium)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
  e2e-tests:           # Every PR + nightly (slow)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**Team Decision:**
- ✅ Run on every push?
- ✅ Require passing before merge?
- ✅ Nightly full suite?

### 3. Flaky Test Policy

**Proposed:**
- 🚫 Zero tolerance for flaky tests
- 📊 Track flakiness rate weekly
- 🔧 Fix or quarantine within 24 hours

**Team Decision:**
- ✅ Agree with policy?
- ✅ Who investigates flaky tests?
- ✅ Escalation procedure?

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not stick with E2E tests only?**  
A: E2E tests are slow (30s each) and brittle. Unit tests give faster feedback (100ms) and are more reliable.

**Q: 80% coverage seems high. Can we start lower?**  
A: Yes, we can start at 60% and ramp up. The key is establishing the process.

**Q: Who maintains the tests?**  
A: Developers own tests for their code. QA reviews coverage and identifies gaps.

**Q: What if tests slow down CI?**  
A: We'll parallelize tests and use smart test selection. Goal is <10min total.

**Q: How do we prevent flaky tests?**  
A: Strict rules: proper waits, deterministic data, no hardcoded timeouts. Fix immediately.
