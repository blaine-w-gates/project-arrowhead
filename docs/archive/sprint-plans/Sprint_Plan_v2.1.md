# Sprint Plan: "Operation: Final Fix"

**Version:** 2.1  
**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Status:** Active  

---

## Sprint Objective

To implement the Architect's definitive fix for the E2E test suite and achieve a 3/3 pass rate, formally concluding the project's stabilization phase.

---

## Sprint Tasks

### Task FF.1: Correct E2E Test Verification Logic (Ref: OMDL Case Study #3)

**Description:** Modify the "Brainstorm Journey" and "Mixed Path" journey tests in `tests/journeys.test.js`. Correct the verification logic to align with the application's actual behavior (i.e., only checking for the final task created from a module, not all 5 steps).

**Technical Details:**
- **Brainstorm Test Fix:** Change verification from expecting all 5 step tasks to only expecting the final step's task
- **Mixed Path Test Fix:** Update verification logic to match the corrected Brainstorm pattern
- **Root Cause:** Per OMDL Case Study #3, the test script contained a logical flaw expecting 5 tasks when the application correctly only creates 1

**Acceptance Criteria:** 
- The `npm test` command runs and reports **3 passing tests** (Brainstorm, Choose, Mixed Path)
- No test failures or timeouts
- All export functionality verified through passing tests

**Implementation Protocol:** Follow Protocol G (implement-then-verify cycle)

---

## Sprint Success Criteria

✅ **3/3 E2E tests passing consistently**  
✅ **Automated verification of all core user journeys**  
✅ **Project stabilization phase formally concluded**  

---

## Traceability

This sprint is authorized by **OMDL Case Study #3: The E2E Test Suite Deadlock**, which documents the Architect's override and mandate for final fix implementation.

---

## Notes

- Current Status: 2/3 tests passing (Choose test consistently passes, proving all core functionality works)
- Architect's diagnostic has identified the exact fix needed
- No application code changes required - this is purely test script correction
- Sprint completion will satisfy OMDL v8.2 requirement: "A sprint is not complete until all tests pass"
