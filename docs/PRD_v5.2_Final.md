## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Vision

Project Arrowhead Team MVP is a **Hybrid Team Collaboration Platform** enabling mid-level managers to:
- Manage multiple strategic projects with "Project Vision" framework
- Collaborate with real team members in real-time
- Use "virtual personas" for role-based task assignment
- Transform strategy into actionable tasks
- Track completion automatically (objectives) and manually (projects)

### 1.2 Core Value

**For Managers:**
- Multi-project strategic planning
- Role-based team permissions
- "God-view" visibility into team work
- Structured Touchbase check-ins
- Completion tracking with date comparison

**For Team Members:**
- Personal "My Work" dashboard (RRGT)
- Task breakdown with Items (sub-tasks)
- Private "Incognito" tasks
- "Dial" prioritization tool
- Privacy-respecting collaboration

### 1.3 Differentiation

- **Strategy-First:** 17-question journey (Brainstorm ‚Üí Choose ‚Üí Objectives)
- **Hybrid Teams:** Real people + virtual personas
- **Privacy-Respecting:** Incognito tasks hidden from Manager
- **Focus-Driven:** Dial UI for daily priorities
- **Completion-Aware:** Automatic + manual progress tracking

---

## 2. User Roles (RBAC)

### 2.1 Five Roles

**Account Owner:** Full access (pays for account)  
**Account Manager:** Identical to Account Owner  
**Project Owner:** Create projects, objectives, tasks (no billing/team management)  
**Objective Owner:** Manage assigned objectives (Tab 3), conduct Touchbases (cannot edit 17-step journey)  
**Team Member:** View assigned projects, manage own RRGT (cannot create tasks, cannot see other RRGTs)

### 2.2 Team Member Lifecycle

**Virtual Persona:** Manager types name in Permission Grid ‚Üí Label for task assignment  
**Conversion:** Manager assigns role, projects, enters email, sends invite ‚Üí Real member  
**Deletion:** Real member deletes account ‚Üí Reverts to Virtual Persona (data preserved, "Send Invite" reappears)

---

## 3. Application Structure: 4-Tab UI

**Step 1: The Question**
```
‚ùì Do you have a name and clearly understand what the next objective should be?

[‚úÖ Yes, I know]      [‚ùå No, let's explore]
```

**If YES:**
1. Prompt: "Enter objective name"
2. User enters name (e.g., "Launch new product beta")
3. Open Objectives Module ONLY (7 questions, steps 11-17)
4. Skip Brainstorm and Choose entirely

**If NO (Exploration Flow):**
1. Create draft objective: "Untitled Objective - [timestamp]"
2. Open **Brainstorm Module** (5 questions, steps 1-5)
   - Generate 3-5 potential objective ideas
   - Examples: "Pizza", "Spaghetti", "Breakfast"
3. Then **Choose Module** (5 questions, steps 6-10)
   - Show radio buttons for generated ideas
   - User selects one (e.g., "Spaghetti")
   - Selected name becomes objective name (UPDATE in database)
   - Store alternatives in JSONB for reference
4. Then **Objectives Module** (7 questions, steps 11-17)
   - Detail the chosen objective
   - Add tasks during this process

#### 17-Step Journey Implementation

### 3.3 Tab 3: Scoreboard ‚úÖ

**Purpose:** Task management, Touchbase check-ins

**Context:** Requires project + objective selection

#### Objective Completion Tracker (NEW)
```
‚ùì Are all tasks complete for this objective?
Status: ‚ùå No (8 of 12 tasks complete)     ‚Üê AUTOMATIC

üìÖ Target completion: Nov 15, 2025         ‚Üê MANUAL input
üéØ Actual completion: Not yet              ‚Üê AUTOMATIC timestamp
```

**Automatic Logic:**
```javascript
if (ALL tasks.status === "Done") {
  all_tasks_complete = true;
  actual_completion_date = timestamp_of_last_done;
} else {
  all_tasks_complete = false;
}
```

**When Complete:**

---

### 3.4 Tab 4: RRGT üêá (Rabbit Race Goal Tracker)

**Purpose:** Personal "My Work" dashboard

#### View & Filters
- **Project:** Multi-select checkboxes
- **Objective:** Multi-select checkboxes
- **Team Member:** Multi-select checkboxes (Manager only)

#### Manager "God-View"

## 5. Real-Time Requirements

### 5.1 Tab 2: Lock-Based Editing (Objectives)

**Technology:** WebSocket (Supabase Realtime)

**Flow:**
1. User A clicks edit ‚Üí Acquire lock
2. User B tries to edit ‚Üí See "[User A] is editing..." banner
3. User A inactive 5 min ‚Üí Auto-save, release lock
4. User A saves ‚Üí Broadcast update via WebSocket ‚Üí All viewers refresh

### 5.2 Tab 3 ‚Üî Tab 4: Task Status Sync

**Technology:** WebSocket bidirectional updates

**Flow:**
1. Team Member updates task status in Tab 4 (RRGT)
2. WebSocket broadcasts to all viewers
3. Tab 3 (Scoreboard) updates instantly for all users viewing that objective

### 5.3 Tab 3: Touchbase Lock-Based Editing

**Same as Objectives:** One editor at a time, 5-min timeout, WebSocket updates

---

## 6. Permissions System

### 6.1 Architecture: RBAC + Project Assignment

**Base Layer:** 5 Roles (Account Owner, Account Manager, Project Owner, Objective Owner, Team Member)

**Override Layer:** Project Assignments
- Stored in junction table: `team_member_project_assignments`
- User can only see content for assigned projects
- Assignment controls visibility across Tabs 2, 3, 4

### 6.2 Permission Matrix

| Action | Account Owner | Account Manager | Project Owner | Objective Owner | Team Member |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Create Project | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Edit Project Vision | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Create Objective | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Edit 17-Step Journey | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Manage Tasks (Tab 3) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (assigned only) | ‚ùå |
| Create Touchbase | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (assigned only) | ‚ùå |
| View Other RRGTs | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Manage Own RRGT | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Create Database Tasks | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Create Items/Incognito | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage Team/Billing | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### 6.3 Row-Level Security (RLS)

**Implementation:** PostgreSQL RLS policies enforce permissions

**Key Policies:**
- Team members can only see data for teams they belong to
- Project-level visibility controlled by `team_member_project_assignments` table
- Touchbases visible only to creator + assigned team member
- Incognito tasks never in database (localStorage only)

---

## 7. Billing Model

### 7.1 Pricing Tiers

**Small Team:** $29/month (1-10 members)  
**Large Team:** $99/month (11-50 members)

**"Member" Definition:** BOTH real people AND virtual personas count toward limit

### 7.2 Billing Integration

**Provider:** Stripe Checkout + Billing Portal  
**Price IDs:**
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_SMALL_TEAM` (in env vars)
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_LARGE_TEAM` (in env vars)

**Entitlement Logic:**
- Subscription status ‚àà {active, trialing, past_due} ‚Üí Access granted
- Canceled/expired ‚Üí Access revoked (data preserved)

---

---

## 10. Finalized Decisions

All original blocking questions (Q1-Q5 from v5.0) are now ANSWERED and incorporated:

**Q1 (Virtual Persona Workflow):** Manager uses Tab 4 RRGT "God-view" multi-select filter  
**Q2 (Incognito in Dial):** Manager sees "[Private Task]" placeholder  
**Q3 (Team Merge):** Deferred to post-MVP (UUIDs in schema for future support)  
**Q4 (Permission Grid):** Simplified version approved (5 roles + project assignment)  
**Q5 (Real-Time Tech):** Lock-based editing approved (1-2 weeks work)  

All UI/UX questions from Cascade's analysis are now ANSWERED and documented in Sections 3.1-3.4.

---

## 11. Implementation Notes

### 11.1 Free Version Code Integration

**17-Step Journey Pages:** Exist in `/website-integration/ArrowheadSolution/` codebase

**Adaptation Strategy:**
- Reuse existing journey components (Brainstorm, Choose, Objectives modules)
- Wrap in Yes/No branching logic (new wrapper component)
- Embed in full-screen overlay (not separate pages)
- Add progress indicator and navigation

**Research Required:** Locate and study existing journey page code before implementation begins.

### 11.2 Completion Tracker Implementation

**Objective Completion (Automatic):**
```javascript
// Trigger on task status update
function updateObjectiveCompletion(objectiveId) {
  const tasks = getTasksForObjective(objectiveId);
  const allDone = tasks.every(task => task.status === 'Done');
  
  if (allDone) {
    updateObjective(objectiveId, {
      all_tasks_complete: true,
      actual_completion_date: new Date()
    });
  } else {
    updateObjective(objectiveId, {
      all_tasks_complete: false,
      actual_completion_date: null
    });
  }
}
```

**Project Completion (Manual):**
- Simple boolean toggle controlled by Manager
- No automatic logic
