Phase 2, Step 2.1: Verification Failure Report
I have analyzed the code provided by the Assistant. The Agent's global rollout has failed verification due to multiple critical errors and deviations from the plan.

Confirmed Failures:

Protocol Violation - onclick Re-introduced: The Agent explicitly added onclick="handleSidebarToggle()" to the new hamburger button in choose_step4.html and, according to its logs, all other files. This directly violates the 'Standard Navigation Pattern' and re-introduces the exact type of bug we just fixed. This is a critical failure.

Code Duplication: As the Assistant correctly noted, a duplicate hamburger button was added inside the main container of choose_step4.html. This is sloppy and will cause UI issues.

HTML/JS Mismatch: The Agent added a static #sidebarOverlay div to the HTML, but the handleSidebarToggle() function in main.js (the correct, robust version from the Assistant) dynamically creates the overlay. This means we have a redundant, unused div in all 19 HTML files.

CSS Conflicts: The Assistant has reported that the Agent created CSS conflicts in style.css by adding new rules without removing the old, conflicting ones.

Architect's Diagnosis
The Agent has proven itself fundamentally unreliable for complex, multi-part global changes. It hallucinates its own implementation details, deviates from verified components, and re-introduces patterns that are explicitly forbidden by our project's architectural principles. Its self-reported verification is meaningless.

From now on, the Agent will only be used for simple, single-action tasks that can be described in one sentence (e.g., "delete this specific line from these 10 files"). All complex rollouts must be managed through a more granular process with the Assistant.

Corrective Action Plan: "Operation Clean Sweep"
We must now meticulously clean up the Agent's mistakes. We will use the Assistant for this entire process.

Step 1: Fix the onclick violation and remove duplicates.

Action: Issue a precise prompt to the Assistant.

Prompt for Assistant: "Please perform a global refactoring. In every HTML file in the project:

Find all instances of <button id="sidebarToggleBtn" onclick="handleSidebarToggle()">.

Remove the onclick="handleSidebarToggle()" attribute from them.

If you find a duplicate sidebarToggleBtn inside the main content div, delete the duplicate entirely.

In the <script> tag at the bottom of each file, add a new event listener:

JavaScript

const sidebarToggleButton = document.getElementById('sidebarToggleBtn');
if (sidebarToggleButton) {
    sidebarToggleButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
        handleSidebarToggle();
    });
}
Afterward, show me the final, corrected code for choose_step4.html to verify."

Step 2: Remove the redundant HTML overlay.

Action: Once Step 1 is verified, issue a prompt to the Assistant.

Prompt for Assistant: "Please perform a global deletion. In every HTML file in the project, find and delete the entire line containing <div id="sidebarOverlay"></div>. Then, show me the <body> section of objectives_step7.html to verify."

Step 3: Resolve CSS conflicts.

Action: Once Step 2 is verified, issue a prompt to the Assistant.

Prompt for Assistant: "Please show me the conflicting CSS rules in style.css related to the sidebar that you mentioned previously."

(Follow-up Action): Once the Assistant shows the conflicting code, we will instruct it to delete the incorrect, older block of CSS.

Only after these three steps are complete and verified can we proceed to Phase 3.
